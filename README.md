# Compiling TypeScript
1. Install the TypeScript compiler:- The easiest way to install TypeScript is through npm, the Node.js Package Manager. If you have npm installed, you can install TypeScript globally (-g) on your computer by:

npm install -g typescript

You can test your install by checking the version or help.

tsc --version

tsc --help

Another option is to install the TypeScript compiler locally in your project (npm install --save-dev typescript) and has the benefit of avoiding possible interactions with other TypeScript projects you may have.

2. Transpile TypeScript into JavaScript
To test that you have the TypeScript compiler tsc installed correctly and a working program, open a terminal and type tsc main.ts.
